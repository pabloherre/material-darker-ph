## 🎨 Overview

**Material Darker PH** is a sleek, high-contrast dark theme designed for long coding sessions. Building upon the classic Material Darker aesthetics, this version brings refined color palettes, improved syntax highlighting visibility, and a modern feel to your editor.

Perfect for developers who love the Material Design philosophy but want a deeper, more immersive dark mode experience.

## ✨ Features

-   **Deep Dark Background**: Reduces eye strain during night-time coding.
-   **Vibrant Syntax Highlighting**: Carefully selected colors to make code pop without being harsh.
-   **Consistent UI**: Polished editor components (sidebar, activity bar, status bar) for a cohesive look.
-   **Optimized for Legibility**: Enhanced contrast ratios for better readability.
